# Tree Procedural Generation

Created with unity 2019.4.14f1 - URP

You will find the generator in Window -> TreeGenerator
Do not forget to put a leaves mesh (the default sphere for example)
The trunk / leaves materials should be found automatically but you can change them manually, if you use another RP for example.

Have fun!
